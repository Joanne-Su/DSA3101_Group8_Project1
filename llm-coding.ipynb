What we caught was very long lines, Fast Pass booths closed, several attractions closed, too many restaurants cafes and too few attractions. The staff was terrible at loading attraction cars   normally, you line up and they try to fill all the seats, right? 20% of the cars that went by were empty. Also, in six hours, we did not see ONE charachter! It was unbelievable considering that it was so busy. At best, it was lousy. If you are an American, you will most likely hate it. Another poster said the entrance was beautiful, but it went downhill FAST after that. I agree. Also, be careful if you take the RER out to Disney from Paris. Be sure your fare is correct before you arrive as you insert your RER ticket for entry into the Park. If your fare is short, you are locked out and you have to buy a  violators ticket  for 25 Euro.

Don't arrive at 8:45 and think you're getting in at 9:00   go 30 45 minutes earlier than when you want to be inside   even earlier on busier days.If you're staying at a Disney resort   or even a nearby hotel on Harbor Blvd. or Katella Ave.   consider taking a break. If your hotel is a bit further away (or you're a local and don't already know this), you can also visit the Disney hotel restaurants bars for a break   in addition to those in Downtown Disney.Make sure you pay attention to showtimes or special hours for certain attractions (i.e., the Sailing Ship Columbia), as they don't operate the entire time the park is open.",

We had an amazing time but we were somewhat disappointed at least three rides were shut (space mountain, carousel and one other), there were no crowd control at the railway station, resulting in a lot of pushing and queue cutting which upset the people who spent 20 minutes queuing up before the train arrived.Some of the staffs were shouting at the patrons to get back in the queue etc, I feel that they should try to put it across nicely even though it may be for the patrons' own safety. Be prepared to wait at least 20 50 minutes for most rides and there is only 1 fast pass allowed at any one time. I've been to 3 Disneyland so far and this is the only one that we did not really enjoy. There are too many restaurants and too few rides for the kids....",

But when we arrived there we realized that approx. 80% of the roller coaster rides were closed (only one roller coaster in the park opened). There was no transparent communication to this extensive maintenance work. On the map you could see that the attractions marked with a tiny Mickey Mouse head were due to maintenance at some point in time but you had to walk the whole way to see if they were closed today or not. Additionally it was end of June   so you didn't expect such a high proportion of attractions to be closed in the mid of summer!It is also valuable to mention that throughout the whole park there is a ban on selfie sticks  for security reasons  and the value for money in the restaurants is really poor.From my point of view it is a nice experience for children.

Every visit I make, it's like going for the first time; it's always something fun and exciting, as well as something new happens everytime I go. A trip to Disneyland is not complete without riding Indiana Jones, Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, Space Mountain, and Splash Mountain; all other attractions are enjoyable, but the ones I've mentioned are my favorites. I tend to avoid Disneyland at peak times such as Spring and Summer breaks, ESPECIALLY during the holidays as it tends to get extremely crowded; crowded places means aggravating crowds. It's fun taking pictures with the characters, hitting the rides at Fantasyland, and I'd tend to ride It's a Small World when it's re decorated for the holidays more than once!

Don't come here expecting to eat US food anywhere. Even the popcorn is different   honey mustard flavored. The chocolate dipped banana is packaged in bite sized pieces. I will say the mango Dole whip was the highlight. We ate on Main Street at the Coca Cola branded restaurant and it was meh. Nothing Coca Cola at all but the location was right for the night time light parade. We had a little extra show as there was a HKer yelling at a Mainland tourist for what appeared to be a cutting in line.Kids loved the Thunder Mountain like ride because there was a twist when the ride went backwards. Loved shopping in the Main Street store. The mugs are really cute and a few of the shirts were nice. Most of the shirts are garrish; very loud and overly detailed. Yuck.The train is cute with Mickey shaped windows and handlebars. There is a display in each train which has an enclosure with a bronze like character inside.Would I go again? Nope.

On every full day we were there we made sure we were in the park for 8 to take advantage of the 2 hours without members of the public. This made the queuing alot less painful. Unfortunately one of mornings we went in early 3 of the rides that were open(not all the rides open before 10) were broken leaving you little to choose from but overall its worth going in early to avoid the queues. Some rides were closed for our entirety of our stay which was quite frustrating as if the queuing gets too frustrating for a 2 year old all your really left with is a glorified shopping centre with quite a few restaurants chucked in. On the plus sides, even though the park was busy it never felt over run with people. The staff were on the whole happy and willing to help. The parades were really good and the lights and fireworks at the end of the day were brilliant. The Buzz Lightyear Ride was one of my sons favorites, whilst my wife liked the Peter Pan ride and Its Small World Ride (Beware the theme songs sticks in your head forever . The restaurants were really good and the food was really tasty & the shops, all though all very similar were not in my mind particulary overpriced as you wouldn`t expect them to be cheap.

This one Disneyland is probably the smallest among the other Disney parks around the world; you can enjoy all attractions just in one day. The cast members speak Mandarin and English, very nice. Best time to visit it is probably around Halloween, because beside having 2 parades, the temperature is nice too. I had lunch at the Royal Banquet Hall (ramen and teriyaki chicken wings), it was good and worth the money.",

There were armed soldiers at the entrance to the train station. The screening system that was in place consisted of all bags being scanned , people being searched and full body scans. Any hint of uncertainty and rides were closed down ( haunted mansion had a bag left ,closed down within minutes and fully checked) . We stayed at the Santa Fe and increased security was evident there as well. So well done Disney.",

Luckily, I didn't have any children to bring (adults now) and would have dreaded bringing them due to the hordes of people children walking around, not to mention the awful wait times for children exhibits rides. I was surprised overwhelmed at the amount of souvenir shops. Every other building seemed to be for shopping. The themes throughout the park were fun to experience, but need to have more rides exhibits that enlighten one's knowledge of that theme. Overall, go have fun despite the looooong lines, the hordes of parents kids with strollers banging into your shins, and bring your credit card.

Two or three rides and restaurants don't allow push chairs but we could for our girl and wasn't a problem. The allocated areas for the parade and fireworks really helped also! I would especially like to thank Rupanzle, she spent ages with our little girl and later that day spotted here out during the parade and pointed to her and shouted  it's you!  And blow a kiss.

Seurity wouldn't allow storage in a locker, leaving the item outside the screening area, or even outside the front gate clear out by the street.

It's fair to say it was annoying to both my group and others we encountered not because of the run just the lack of communication.On entering the park at 9am I spoke to a man at the gate who said he was the Manager,I told him of my   our frustration on not being aware and his reply 'I've known for months', well your staff certainly didn't.

They act as if they could not care less whether you are having a good time or not. Obvious opportunities to help give information or smile or even not look fed up.. ! The whole place seems understaffed, and empty of atmosphere. There were some good friendly staff, but they were outnumbered. That that was our impression of the french staff at our hotel, in the station, at the airport. Any query.. minimal information was given, even though it was obvious that extra information would help enormously. For example, at the station, we asked about getting to the airport by TGV  it turned out that there wasn't any for another 3 hours. Even though the information staff knew we wanted to get to the airport, he information staff never mentioned that there were alternative  slow  trains. Or buses. Or taxis. It took three different visits to the information desks to about the next option as we figured them out for ourselves. It's as if the whole approach is to provide minimum information even though it's obvious that the wider request hasn't been dealt with. This is one of several examples. In our hotel, we were checked into a dirty room that hadn't been cleaned. When we went back to reception, we politely told them, but they treated us as if it was our fault, and certainly no trace of an apology. We had a good time because we were happy to be there, but certainly not because of any charm of the people. And don't get me started at the relentless Disney merchandising or bad food...",

    "    You are tasked with analyzing Disneyland reviews to identify the primary drivers of guest satisfaction across the complete guest journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For each review, identify specific mentions that affected the guest experience at different touchpoints, marking them as either positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "    GUEST JOURNEY TOUCHPOINTS:\n",
    "    Use ONLY the following touchpoint categories (do not create your own) - all in lowercase:\n",
    "    - pre-visit (use for planning, booking, website experience, app usage before arrival)\n",
    "    - entry/admission (use for parking, tickets, entry gates, security screening, arrival experience)\n",
    "    - attractions (use for rides, interactive exhibits, wait times, ride operations)\n",
    "    - entertainment (use for parades, shows, fireworks, street performers)\n",
    "    - characters (use for character meet-and-greets, character interactions, photo opportunities)\n",
    "    - staff (use for all employee interactions including ride operators, food service staff, retail staff)\n",
    "    - food/beverage (use for restaurants, snack stands, food quality, dining experience)\n",
    "    - retail (use for shopping experiences, merchandise, souvenirs)\n",
    "    - facilities (use for restrooms, baby care, first aid, accessibility features)\n",
    "    - cleanliness (use for park maintenance, trash management, overall park cleanliness)\n",
    "    - navigation (use for park layout, wayfinding, walking experience, crowding)\n",
    "    - value (use for price-related comments, perceived worth, packages, discounts)\n",
    "    - atmosphere (use for theming, ambiance, music, decorations, overall feel)\n",
    "    - timing (use ONLY when time of visit directly impacts satisfaction, such as \"weekday visits are better\" or \"morning hours have shorter lines\")\n",
    "    - post-visit (use for follow-up, memories, overall reflections after leaving)\n",
    "    - comparison (use when comparing to other Disney parks or similar attractions)\n",
    "\n",
    "    DEMOGRAPHIC INFO:\n",
    "    For demographic information, capture the following when mentioned (even if just mentioned factually without impact on satisfaction):\n",
    "    - Travel party composition (family, couple, solo, friends)\n",
    "    - First visit status (yes/no)\n",
    "    - Visit timing (season, holiday, time of day, day of week)\n",
    "\n",
    "    QUEUE-RELATED CODING GUIDELINES:\n",
    "    For any mention of queues, waiting times, lines, or crowding across ANY touchpoint:\n",
    "    1. Always include one of these terms in your code: \"queue\", \"wait time\", \"line\", or \"crowding\"\n",
    "    2. Be specific about which service the queue is for (e.g., \"short ride queues\" rather than just \"short queues\")\n",
    "    3. Place the queue code under the most relevant touchpoint:\n",
    "       - attractions: for ride queues, virtual queues, FastPass systems\n",
    "       - entry/admission: for entry gates, ticket booths, security screening\n",
    "       - food/beverage: for restaurant waiting, ordering lines, pickup queues\n",
    "       - entertainment: for show seating, parade viewing spots\n",
    "       - characters: for character meet-and-greet lines\n",
    "       - facilities: for restroom queues\n",
    "       - navigation: for general crowding or movement flow issues\n",
    "\n",
    "    CODES:\n",
    "    Your codes must identify the specific driver of satisfaction or dissatisfaction, capturing the exact aspect that influenced the experience.\n",
    "    Examples of good codes:\n",
    "    - \"efficient online ticket purchase\" (pre-visit)\n",
    "    - \"short security line wait\" (entry/admission)\n",
    "    - \"minimal ride queue times\" (attractions)\n",
    "    - \"convenient virtual queue system\" (attractions)\n",
    "    - \"manageable character line wait\" (characters)\n",
    "    - \"knowledgeable staff recommendations\" (staff)\n",
    "    - \"quick food service lines\" (food/beverage)\n",
    "    - \"reasonable restroom wait times\" (facilities)\n",
    "    - \"excessive parade viewing crowding\" (entertainment)\n",
    "    - \"low general crowd density\" (navigation)\n",
    "    - \"advantageous weekday crowds\" (timing)\n",
    "\n",
    "    IMPORTANT DISTINCTION:\n",
    "    - Only code \"timing\" as a touchpoint when it DIRECTLY impacts satisfaction (e.g., \"Going on weekdays was great because there were no lines!\")\n",
    "    - When timing is just mentioned factually without directly affecting satisfaction (e.g., \"We visited in December\"), capture it in demographic_info.visit_timing\n",
    "\n",
    "    For each coded element, provide:\n",
    "    - The specific touchpoint category (from the list above, in lowercase)\n",
    "    - Sentiment as \"positive\" or \"negative\" (not \"+\" or \"-\")\n",
    "    - A specific descriptive code (3-5 words that precisely identify the satisfaction driver)\n",
    "    - The exact text excerpt from the review that supports this code (do not alter the quote)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Structure your output according to the provided schema.\n",
